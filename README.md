# Pyalmanac (Python 3 version)

**'End of Life' ANNOUNCEMENT**

Pyalmanac is nearing the end of its useful days. Almanacs generated after the next few
years should not be used for navigational purposes. SFalmanac (or Skyalmanac with
some restrictions regarding the accuracy of sunset/twilight/sunrise and moonrise/moonset)
are the new norm as these are based on the more accurate algorithms currently employed
in the NASA JPL HORIZONS System (the same algorithms are implemented in Skyfield).

Pyalmanac is implemented using Ephem (originally named PyEphem), which in turn uses XEphem that uses the
VSOP87D algorithms for the planets. XEphem is also 'end of life' as no further updates are planned.
However the key discrepancies are related to the projected speed of Earth's rotation, or "sidereal time".

Skyfield-based almanacs (SFalmanac and Skyalmanac) now use the International Earth Rotation and Reference 
Systems Service (IERS) Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) data which are forecast for at least the coming 
12 months (and updated weekly). Accurate assessment of "sidereal time" will minimize GHA 
discrepancies in general. This applies to to all celestial objects.

**Description**

Pyalmanac is a **Python 3** script that essentially creates the daily pages of the Nautical Almanac **using the UTC timescale**, which is ***not optimal for navigation purposes*** :frowning_face:. 
Official Nautical Almanacs employ a UT timescale (equivalent to UT1).
The "daily pages" are tables that are needed for celestial navigation with a sextant. 
Although you are strongly advised to purchase the official Nautical Almanac, this program will reproduce the tables with no warranty or guarantee of accuracy.

This version of Pyalmanac was developed by Andrew Bauer based on the original Pyalmanac by Enno Rodegerdts. Various improvements, enhancements and bugfixes have been included. 
Pyalmanac contains its own star database (similar to the database in Ephem 3.7.6 whose accuracy was sub-optimal).
It is updated with data from the Hipparcos Star Catalogue and the GHA/Dec star data now matches a sample page from a Nautical Almanac typically to within 0Â°0.1'.

NOTE: Pyalmanac contains its own star database - it does not use the version supplied with Ephem, hence updating from 3.7.6 to 3.7.7.1 is harmless. Star names are chosen to comply with Nautical Almanacs.  
NOTE: if still required, a Python 2.7 script with identical functionality can be found at: https://github.com/aendie/Pyalmanac-Py2  

**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**

I, Andrew Bauer, wish to thank Enno Rodegerdts for permission to update his GitHub site. Without Enno's pioneering work on the original Pyalmanac I would never have started (or known how to start) on this journey. I also thank the experts who have helped me... especially Brandon Rhodes, author of Ephem/PyEphem and Skyfield, for fixing minor issues I identified.  

**AVAILABLE VERSIONS**

**NOTE: the Python Package Index (PyPI) edition is here:** https://pypi.org/project/pyalmanac/  
**Users are encouraged to install the PyPI edition instead.**  

Two versions (other than Pyalmanac) are available here: https://github.com/aendie

* **Pyalmanac** is the fastest with "somewhat limited" accuracy that is sufficient for nautical navigation up to 2022 or so.  
* **SFalmanac** is the slowest and most accurate; almost entirely based on *Skyfield*. *Ephem* is only used for planet magnitudes (because these are not yet in *Skyfield*).  
* **Skyalmanac** is a hybrid version that is significantly faster than SFalmanac. *Ephem* is used for planet magnitudes and for all planet transits, sunrise, twilight and sunset calculations as well as for moonrise and moonset.

**UPDATE: Mar 2020**

A new parameter in *config.py* enables one to choose between A4 and Letter-sized pages. A [new approach](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#pep-3101-a-new-approach-to-string-formatting) to string formatting has been implemented:
the [old](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting) style Python string formatting syntax has been replaced by the [new](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax) style string formatting syntax. 

**UPDATE: Jun 2020**

The Equation Of Time is shaded whenever EoT is negative indicating that apparent solar time is slow compared to mean solar time (mean solar time > apparent solar time).

**UPDATE: Feb 2021**

Minor changes are included here to this original (non-PyPI) edition to reflect some of the adaptation that was required (e.g. integrate *increments.py* into *pyalmanac.py* as Option 5) to create a PyPI (Python Package Index) edition making this original (non-PyPI) and the PyPI editions similar. Both editions create identical almanacs and the [PyPI edition](https://pypi.org/project/pyalmanac/) is the preferred choice for users.

**UPDATE: Apr 2021**

A double moonrise or moonset on the same day is now highlighted for better legibility. Event Time tables can now be generated - these are the tables containing data in hours:minutes:seconds, e.g. sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset and Meridian Passage.
Accuracy to to the second of time is not required for navigational purposes, but may be used to compare accuracy with other algorithms. Some internal technical enhancements and minor changes to text are also included.

**UPDATE: May 2021**

The indication of objects (Sun or Moon) continuously above or below the horizon has been corrected.

Regarding Moon Data: ".. .." has been added to indicate that the moonrise/moonset event occurs the following day (at the specified latitude). If there is no moonrise/moonset for two or more consecutive days, black boxes indicate "moon below horizon"; white boxes indicate "moon above horizon". This brings it in line with Nautical Almanacs. (Previously they were only displayed when there was no moonrise *and* no moonset on a single day.)

Correction to Sun Data: "Sun continually above/below horizon" now shown if it applies to both Sunrise and Sunset, or *additionally* to both Civil Twilight Start & End; or *additionally* to both Astronomical Twilight Start & End, i.e. as two, four or six events per day and latitude. This brings it in line with Nautical Almanacs.

## Requirements

&emsp;Most of the computation is done by the free Ephem library.  
&emsp;Typesetting is typically done by MiKTeX or TeX Live.  
&emsp;These need to be installed:

* Python v3.4 or higher (the latest version is recommended)
* Ephem >= 3.7.6
* MiKTeX&ensp;or&ensp;TeX Live

## Files required in the execution folder:

* &ast;.py
* Ra.jpg
* A4chartNorth_P.pdf

### INSTALLATION GUIDELINES on Windows 10:

&emsp;Install Python 3.9.1 (should be in the system environment variable PATH, e.g. )  
&emsp;&ensp;**C:\\Python39\Scripts;C:\\Python39;** .....  
&emsp;Install MiKTeX 21.1 from https://miktex.org/  
&emsp;When MiKTeX first runs it will require installation of additional packages.  
&emsp;Run Command Prompt as Administrator, go to your Python folder and execute, e.g.:

&emsp;**cd C:\\Python39**  
&emsp;**python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip**  
&emsp;... for a first install:  
&emsp;**pip3 uninstall pyephem ephem**  
&emsp;**pip3 install ephem**  
&emsp;... if already installed, check for upgrade explicitly:  
&emsp;**pip3 install --upgrade ephem**  

&emsp;Put the Pyalmanac files in a new folder, run Command Prompt and start with:  
&emsp;**py -3 pyalmanac.py**

&emsp;If using MiKTeX 21 or higher, executing 'option 5' (Increments and Corrections) will probably fail with  
&emsp;**! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=3000000].**  
&emsp;To resolve this problem (assuming MiKTeX has been installed for all users),  
&emsp;open a Command Prompt as Administrator and enter:  
&emsp;**initexmf --admin --edit-config-file=pdflatex**  
&emsp;This opens **pdflatex.ini** in Notepad. Add the following line:  
&emsp;**extra_mem_top = 1000000**  
&emsp;and save the file. Problem solved. For more details go [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/438902/how-to-increase-memory-size-for-xelatex-in-miktex/438911#438911)

### INSTALLATION GUIDELINES on Ubuntu 19.10 or 20.04:

&emsp;Ubuntu 19 and higher come with Python 3 preinstalled,  
&emsp;however pip may need to be installed:  
&emsp;**sudo apt install python3-pip**

&emsp;Install the following TeX Live package:  
&emsp;**sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra**

&emsp;Install the required astronomical library:  
&emsp;**pip3 uninstall pyephem ephem**  
&emsp;**pip3 install ephem**

&emsp;Put the Pyalmanac files in a folder and start with:  
&emsp;**python3 pyalmanac.py**  


### INSTALLATION GUIDELINES on MAC:

&emsp;Every Mac comes with python preinstalled.  
&emsp;(Please choose this version of Pyalmanac if Python 3.* is installed.)  
&emsp;You need to install the Ephem library to use Pyalmanac.  
&emsp;Type the following commands at the commandline (terminal app):

&emsp;**sudo easy_install pip**  
&emsp;**pip uninstall pyephem ephem**  
&emsp;**pip install ephem**  

&emsp;If this command fails, your Mac asks you if you would like to install the header files.  
&emsp;Do so - you do not need to install the full IDE - and try again.

&emsp;Install TeX/LaTeX from http://www.tug.org/mactex/

&emsp;Now you are almost ready. Put the Pyalmanac files in any directory and start with:  
&emsp;**python pyalmanac**  
&emsp;or  
&emsp;**./pyalmanac**
